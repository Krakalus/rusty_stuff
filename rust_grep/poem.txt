The Rusty Crab
(by Grok & You 🦀❤️)

In the land of borrow checker,
Lives a crab that's quite the wrecker.
With its claws of red and blue,
It fights the bugs that bother you!

Fearless ownership it claims,
No null pointers, no wild flames.
Move semantics, so clean and tight,
References borrowed left and right.

When panic comes, it does not crash,
unwrap_or_else will save your hash.
With match and if let so grand,
Patterns flow like grains of sand.

Cargo build and cargo run,
Testing code is so much fun!
From newbie fear to fearless might,
We code in Rust both day and night!

So raise your claws and cheer with me,
For Rust has set our hearts all free!
The future's safe, the future's bright,
Thanks to the crab that owns the night! 🦀✨
